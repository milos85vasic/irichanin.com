/**
* The best and safest way to extend the Humean WordPress theme with your own custom code is to create a child theme.
* You can add temporary code snippets and hacks to the current functions.php file, but unlike with a child theme, they will be lost on upgrade.
*
* If you don't know what a child theme is, you really want to spend 5 minutes learning how to use child themes in WordPress, you won't regret it :) !
